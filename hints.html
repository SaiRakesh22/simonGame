            <li>Press any key in the keyboard. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.</li>
            <li>Simon will remember the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.</li>
            <li>Simon will remember these first two signals and add one.</li>
            <li>Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.></li>
            <li>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.</li>
